There are two collections of computer code in this archive: the
jneurosci2012 folder and jnphysiol2012 folder.  The jneurosci2012
folder is for

Jones PW, Gabbiani F. (2012) Logarithmic Compression of Sensory
    Signals within the Dendritic Tree of a Collision-Sensitive
    Neuron. J Neurosci, In press.

This jneurosci2012 version includes code to reproduce figures and
analysis in press right now, and we've added it to the same model
entry alongside the previous version jnphysiol2012, for the 2012B
paper

Jones PW, Gabbiani F. (2012B) Impact of neural noise on a
    sensory-motor pathway signaling impending collision. J
    Neurophysiol 107:1067â€“1079.

just in a separate version folder, since it is conceptually
the same (just slight changes in the underlying parameters prevent
merging the two versions).

Please refer to the README files in these subdirectories for more
information.  This code was contributed by Dr Pete Jones.
